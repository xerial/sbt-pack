Minimal project settings example.

To create a package, do:
   
    $ bin/sbt pack

Then, launch a command:

    $ target/pack/bin/hello
    Hello World!!

To install the command to your local folder ~/local/bin, do:

    $ cd target/pack; make install

Install the program in /usr/local/bin:

    $ cd target/pack
    $ sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local
